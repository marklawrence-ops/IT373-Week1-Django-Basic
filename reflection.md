Since I’ve been following along during the lectures, I didn’t run into any major errors that completely broke my code. Still, there were some issues that tested me. One challenge came up during the setup when I couldn’t launch the virtual environment because the system said running scripts was disabled. It took me a while to figure out, but after searching online I was able to resolve it by running the proper command. That was probably the biggest hurdle I faced. There was also another challenge where I wasn't able to 'git add .', but I resolved it easily by looking up how to fix it. The rest were mostly smaller mistakes, like forgetting to update functions in views.py, missing minor syntax errors and typos, or overlooking file name changes when linking HTML templates. With the guidance from your lessons, I was able to fix these mistakes quickly and keep up with the flow of the class. The step-by-step teaching really made it easier to troubleshoot and stay on track. I genuinely appreciate the effort you put into guiding us through the process.
